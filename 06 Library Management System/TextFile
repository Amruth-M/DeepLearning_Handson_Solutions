Understand Search Algorithms

Linear Search:
Checks each element one by one.
Works on unsorted data.
Time complexity: O(n)


Binary Search:
Divides the array in half each time.
Works only on sorted data.
Time complexity: O(log n)
Analysis


Linear Search:
Best case: O(1) (match is first)
Worst case: O(n) (last or not found)
Works even if the data is unsorted


Binary Search:
Time complexity: O(log n)
Requires the array to be sorted
Much faster on large datasets

->When to Use What

Use linear search:
On small or unsorted datasets
When sorting isnâ€™t feasible

Use binary search:
On large datasets that are already sorted
When speed is important
