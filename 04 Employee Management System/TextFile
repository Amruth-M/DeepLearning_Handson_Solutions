Understand Array Representation
How arrays are stored in memory:

Arrays are stored in contiguous memory blocks.

Each element can be accessed directly using an index.

For example, arr[0] gives you the first element instantly — this is constant time (O(1)) access.



Advantages of arrays:

Fast access using index.

Simple and efficient for fixed-size collections.

Easy to traverse in loops.


 Time Complexity Analysis
Add: O(1) — append at the end

Search: O(n) — linear scan

Traverse: O(n) — loop through all

Delete: O(n) — find + shift elements



Limitations of Arrays
Fixed size (you must predefine capacity).

Insertion/deletion in the middle is expensive (requires shifting).

Searching is O(n) unless sorted or indexed.



Use arrays when:

You know the max number of elements in advance.

You need fast index-based access.

You don't do frequent inserts or deletes.
