nderstand Recursive Algorithms
Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller parts of a problem.

Key characteristics:

Has a base case to stop recursion

Solves the problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems

Example Use Case:
Compound interest, Fibonacci series, factorial, tree/graph traversal, etc.


Setup – Recursive Forecast Method
We’ll create a method to calculate the future value given:

Present value

Annual growth rate

Number of years

Formula:  futureValue = presentValue * (1 + growthRate)^years


Analysis
Time Complexity:

The recursion runs once per year → O(n) where n = years

Space Complexity:

Uses O(n) stack space due to recursion
