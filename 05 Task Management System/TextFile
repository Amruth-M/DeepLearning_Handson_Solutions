Understand Linked Lists
Singly Linked List:

Each node has data and a reference to the next node.
You can traverse in only one direction (forward).
Good for dynamic size and frequent insertions/deletions.
Doubly Linked List (just for knowledge):
Each node has prev and next pointers.
Allows traversal in both directions.
Uses more memory but is more flexible.


Analysis
Time complexity:

Add task: O(n) â€“ traversal to end

Search task: O(n)

Delete task: O(n)

Traverse/display: O(n)



->Advantages of linked lists over arrays:

Dynamic size (no fixed limit like arrays)

Inserting/deleting in middle is easier (no shifting like in arrays)

Efficient memory usage (no need to reserve space)
