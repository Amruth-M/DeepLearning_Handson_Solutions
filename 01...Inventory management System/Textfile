01.Why are data structures and algorithms essential for large inventories?
A large warehouse can have thousands of products.

Efficient data structures ensure:

Fast search (to find a product by ID/name)

Quick updates (to change stock or price)

Memory efficiency (to store all products compactly)

Suitable Data Structures:

Data Structure,Use Case,Reason:

->ArrayList	Small data, ordered	Good for sequential access, but slow for lookup by ID
->HashMap	Best for large inventory	Provides O(1) lookup, insert, and delete by key
->TreeMap	Sorted product IDs	If you need products in order, but slightly slower (O(log n))
->LinkedList	Not suitable here	Slower access by index or ID

02.Time Complexities Using HashMap:

Operation	                Method	              Time Complexity

Add Product	                put(id, product)	       O(1)
Update Product	            get(id) & modify	       O(1)
Delete Product	            remove(id)	               O(1)
Display All	                values()	               O(n)
